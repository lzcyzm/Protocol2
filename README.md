# An updated protocol for epitranscriptome analysis from m6A-seq data

# Introduction
The protocol covers the following aspects (or modules) of m6A-seq data analysis :
1. Quality control and alignment of m6A-seq data
1. Differential RNA expression analysis with the input samples of m6A-seq data
1. m6A site detection and characterization (peak calling)
1. Differential m6A methylation analysis (differential analysis)
1. m6A-driven functional network analysis
