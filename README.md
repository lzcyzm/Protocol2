## Introduction
The protocol covers the following aspects (or modules) of m6A-seq data analysis :
1. Quality control and alignment of m6A-seq data
1. m6A site detection and characterization (peak calling)
1. Differential m6A methylation analysis (differential analysis)
1. m6A-driven functional network analysis
   1. Differential expression analysis (with the input samples of m6A-seq data)
   1. Differential  m6A methylation analysis
   1. Joint analysis of differential expression and differential methylation
